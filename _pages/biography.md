Two things excite me the most, computers and language. I learned to code little patterns on LOGO on my primary school computer when I was 10 years old. By the time I was 13, I had realized that computers were the love of my life. Another passion of my life? Languages! I grew up when I had no internet connection in my home, and I also lived in a small town with limited resources for learning a new language. So, whenever I traveled to Kolkata (my nearest big city), I used to get myself a book on language learning. French, German, Chinese, you name it! Fast forward to 2019, I began working as an undergraduate researcher in natural language processing, where I got to play with computers and languages all day! Today, I am a graduate researcher working on multi-modal deep learning. <br><br>
