Hi, I am Shankhanil Ghosh, a computer vision engineer at BigThinx, and I build novel deep learning pipelines for the fashion tech industry. My research interests, apart from Computer Vision also lie in multimodal deep learning, Natural language process and generative AI. I have 3+ years of experience working in deep learning, including both academia and industry. <br><br>
<!-- a Master's student at School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad. My research interests lie in the domain of deep learning, multi modal deep learning, natural language processing and affective computing. <br><br> -->
I have a master's degree in Information Technology from University of Hyderabad, and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Calcutta. I had started my research journey working with <b>social Media NLP </b>, where I developed solutions to use tweets to predict traffic scenarios at a location. The primary focus of the idea was to use traffic-intelligence from tweets to build traffic management heuristics. I am deeply invested in <b>multi-modal deep learning </b> because of the  because of the sheer possibilities it has. I have worked on building affective computing solutions using deep learning. The foundation of this work began in June, 2021, when I was working on building ReSenseNet, a multimodal deep learning architecture for sentiment analysis. Currently, I am working on 3D reconstructure methodologies for the fashion-tech industry.

I have also invested myself in building startups. In the height of COVID in 2020, small F&B business owners and their customers faced a dilemma regarding food and catering services. I, along with a few friends, launched Connet-NoTouch, a web application product that helped such businesses function in a no-contact manner.
