Hi, I am Shankhanil Ghosh, a Master's student at School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad. My research interests lie in the domain of deep learning, multi modal deep learning, natural language processing. <br><br>
Two things excite me the most, computers and language. I learned to code little patterns on LOGO on my primary school computer when I was 10 years old. By the time I was 13, I had realized that computers were the love of my life. Another passion of my life? Languages! I grew up when I had no internet connection in my home, and I also lived in a small town with limited resources for learning a new language. So, whenever I traveled to Kolkata (my nearest big city), I used to get myself a book on language learning. French, German, Chinese, you name it! Fast forward to 2019, I began working as an undergraduate researcher in Natural Language processing, where I got to play with computers and languages all day! Today, I am a graduate researcher working on multi-modal deep learning. <br><br>
Coming to research, I am deeply invested in multi-modal deep learning, along with natural language processing. Currently, I am working on building deep learning solutions for mental health problems in teenagers and young adults. However, I started my research journey working with social Media NLP. I made solutions to use tweets to predict traffic scenarios at a location.
<br>
I have also invested myself in building startups. In the height of COVID in 2020, small F&B business owners and their customers faced a dilemma regarding food and catering services. We launched Connet-NoTouch, a web application product that helped such businesses function in a no-contact manner.
