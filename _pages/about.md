Hi, I am Shankhanil Ghosh, a Master's student at School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad. My research interests lie in the domain of deep learning, multi modal deep learning, natural language processing. <br><br>
I had started my research journey working with <b>social Media NLP </b>. I developed solutions to use tweets to predict traffic scenarios at a location. The primary focus of the idea was to use traffic-intelligence from tweets to build traffic management heuristics. Currently, I am deeply invested in <b>multi-modal deep learning </b> simply because of the sheer possibilities it has. Currently, I am working on building deep learning solutions for mental health problems in teenagers and young adults. The foundation of this work began in June, 2021, when I was working on ReSenseNet, a multimodal deep learning architecture for sentiment analysis. 
<br>
I have also invested myself in building startups. In the height of COVID in 2020, small F&B business owners and their customers faced a dilemma regarding food and catering services. We launched Connet-NoTouch, a web application product that helped such businesses function in a no-contact manner.
