  title={*NeuraGen-A  Low-Resource Neural Network based approach for Gender Classification},

  abstract={Human voice is the source of several important information. This is in the form of  features. These Features help in interpreting various features associated with the speaker and speech. The speaker dependent work researchers  are targeted towards speaker identification, Speaker verification, speaker biometric, forensics using feature, and cross-modal matching via speech and face images. In such context research, it is a very difficult task to come across clean, and well annotated publicly available speech corpus as data set. Acquiring volunteers to generate such dataset is also very expensive, not to mention the enormous amount of effort and time researchers spend to gather such data. The present paper work, a Neural Network proposal as  NeuraGen focused which is a  low-resource ANN architecture.  The proposed tool used to classify gender of the speaker from the speech recordings. We have used speech recordings collected from the ELSDSR and limited TIMIT datasets, from which we extracted 8 speech features, which were pre-processed and then fed into NeuraGen to identify the gender. NeuraGen has successfully achieved accuracy of 90.7407% and F1 score of 91.227% in train and 20-fold cross validation dataset.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
